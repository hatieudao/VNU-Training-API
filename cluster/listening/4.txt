The lecture is about the (25) ____ in Australia, particularly
some causes and how to manage the problem.
Australia has the second lowest rainfall in the world, only
after (26) - In fact, about (27) ___ of this rainfall
evaporates due to long hours of hot sunshine and searing
winds, higher than in other continents.
In many parts of Australia, standing water dries up very
quickly, and rain water barely penetrates the soil because
thirsty plants absorb nearly all of it. In some other parts,
rain water (28) ____ the sandy soils and gets into the rock
below. This kind of water then collects beneath the ground
to form underground lakes. Water from these lakes can be,
in turn, pumped up and tapped for various uses. Australia
has underground water in more than half of its land area,
but this source of water is mostly too (29) for human
consumption or crop irrigation. Despite this, Australian
farmers have to somehow depend on it for watering their
animals and for irrigation where possible.
Underground water is stored in huge underground
reservoirs and returns to the surface as (30) __
Continuous use of underground water in many places over
the years leads to a (31) making it necessary to
pump the water to the surface. Accounting for 18% of total
water consumption, this source of water is very important
to Australia
Apart from this, most water consumed in Australia comes
from the above-ground sources. Australia has more than
300 dams which store water for crop irrigation, flood
regulation, and (32) generation.
